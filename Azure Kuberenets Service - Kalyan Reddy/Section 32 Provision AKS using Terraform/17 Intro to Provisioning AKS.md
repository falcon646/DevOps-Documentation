### Provisioning an Azure AKS Cluster Using Terraform  

In this section, an **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster** is provisioned using **Terraform**. The process involves multiple steps, including SSH key generation, Windows node pool configuration, monitoring setup, Azure AD integration, and system-managed identities.  

#### Steps to Create an Azure AKS Cluster  

- Create SSH Keys for AKS Linux VMs
- Declare Windows Username, Passwords for Windows nodepools. This needs to be done during the creation of cluster for 1st time itself if you have plans for Windows workloads on your cluster
- Understand about Datasources and Create Datasource for Azure AKS latest Version
- Create Azure Log Analytics Workspace Resource in Terraform
- Create Azure AD AKS Admins Group Resource in Terraform
- Create AKS Cluster with default nodepool
- Create AKS Cluster Output Values
- Provision Azure AKS Cluster using Terraform
- Access and Test using Azure AKS default admin --admin
- Access and Test using Azure AD User as AKS Admin

1. **Generate SSH Keys for Linux VMs**  
   - SSH keys are required to access the **Linux-based nodes** in the AKS cluster.  
   - For Windows node pools, **username and passwords** are declared.  
   - The decision to support **Windows workloads** must be made at cluster creation.  

2. **Retrieve the Latest AKS Version Using Terraform Data Source**  
   - Terraform uses **data sources** to dynamically fetch the **latest stable** AKS version.  
   - Azure provides both **preview** and **live** versions; only the **live** version is selected.  

3. **Enable Monitoring and Azure Log Analytics**  
   - **Azure Monitor add-on** is enabled for AKS.  
   - A **Log Analytics Workspace** is created using Terraform.  
   - The **random provider** is used for workspace name generation.  

4. **Integrate AKS with Azure AD**  
   - An **Azure AD AKS Admins group** is created.  
   - The AKS cluster is configured to authenticate users via **Azure AD**.  
   - **System-assigned Managed Identity (MSI)** is used instead of a generic service principal.  

5. **Create the AKS Cluster with Default Node Pool**  
   - The **default node pool** is configured with necessary specifications.  
   - Includes configurations for:  
     - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**  
     - **System-assigned Managed Identity**  
     - **Windows and Linux profiles**  
     - **Network settings**  

6. **Define Output Values and Deploy the AKS Cluster**  
   - Terraform **output values** are defined for easy reference to cluster details.  
   - The **AKS cluster** is provisioned using `terraform apply`.  

7. **Access and Test the AKS Cluster**  
   - Access the AKS cluster using **default admin credentials**.  
   - Validate authentication using **Azure AD users** as AKS admins.  

#### Terraform Components to Be Created  

- **AKS Versions Data Source**  
- **Log Analytics Workspace**  
- **Azure AD Administrator Group**  
- **AKS Cluster with Complete Configuration**  
- **System-Assigned Managed Identity**  
- **RBAC and Add-On Profiles**  
- **Windows and Linux Node Pool Profiles**  
- **Network Configuration**  
- **Output Values**  

All these components will be defined step by step in Terraform, ensuring a **structured** and **scalable** deployment of AKS on Azure.

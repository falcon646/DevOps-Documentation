1. create vpc, provide cidr block(192.168.0./16)
2. create internet gatewat , attach to vpc
3. create 2 subnets , one prrivate one public
   for public subnet , cidr = 192.168.1.0/24 , select az us-east-1a
   for private subnet , cidr = 192.168.2.0/24 , select az us-east-1b
4. create 2 route tables , one for public subnet one for private subnet
   for publc route table , add below entries
   192.168.0.0/16 - local
   0.0.0.0/0 - internet gateway

   for ptivate route table , add only local gateway
   192.168.0.0/16 - local
5. associate the private route table to private subnet and public route table with public subnet
6. enable assignment of public ip in the public subnet
7. create ec2 instance for web server, select the vpc we created and the public subnet
8. assign a security group to the ec2 instnace which allows port 22 and port 80 and create the instance
9. create ec2 instnace in rivate subnet and assign the same security group.
10. public ec2 instnace can be accesed via browser and ssh whereas private ec2 canot be. we can ssh to private ec2 instance via the public ec2 instance 

11. to allow the privye subnets machines to connect to internet you need to use nat gateway.
12. create natgateway in public subnet . 
13. add route to 0.0.0.0/0 as destination and nat gateway as target in the private route table

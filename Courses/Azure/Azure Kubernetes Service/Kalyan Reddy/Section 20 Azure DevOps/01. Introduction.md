### **Azure DevOps

**Azure DevOps** serves as a powerful platform that enables the automation and management of Kubernetes workloads efficiently. It provides end-to-end DevOps capabilities, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring, and security enforcement.  

#### **Key Azure DevOps Components**  
- **Azure Repos (Source Code Management)**  
    - A Git-based version control system to store application code, Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform scripts.  
    - Helps in tracking changes and collaborating on deployments.  
- **Azure Pipelines (CI/CD Automation for AKS)**  
    - Automates the build, test, and deployment of containerized applications.  
    - Can be integrated with AKS to streamline deployments.  
    - Uses **YAML-based pipelines** or classic UI-based pipelines.  
    - **Example CI/CD Flow for AKS:**  
        - Checkout the source code (application + Kubernetes YAML/Helm charts).  
        - Build a Docker image and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).  
        - Deploy the application to AKS using Helm/Kubernetes manifests.  
- **Azure Artifacts (Package Management for AKS Dependencies)**  
    - Stores dependencies such as Helm charts, container images, and other artifacts required for AKS workloads.  
    - Ensures versioning and consistency in deployments.  
- **Azure Boards (Agile Project Management for DevOps Teams)**  
    - Tracks issues, feature requests, and tasks related to AKS deployments.  
    - Helps in sprint planning and backlog management.  
- **Azure Test Plans (Automated Testing for AKS Workloads)**  
    - Enables integration testing for AKS-based applications before deployment.  
    - Ensures reliability by running performance and functional tests on Kubernetes services.  



#### **Common Use Cases of Azure DevOps**  

- **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD for Kubernetes)**  
    - Automates deployment of microservices to AKS using pipelines.  
    - Example: A pipeline that triggers on a GitHub commit, builds a new container image, pushes it to ACR, and updates AKS deployments.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AKS**  
    - Automates cluster provisioning using **Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates** within Azure DevOps Pipelines.  
    - Ensures consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.  
- **Secrets and Configuration Management**  
    - Manages Kubernetes secrets and environment configurations securely using **Azure Key Vault** integration.  
- **Helm-Based Deployments**  
    - Uses **Helm charts** to package, version, and deploy applications to AKS.  
    - Automates rolling updates and rollback strategies.  
- **Canary Deployments & Blue-Green Deployments**  
    - Uses **Azure DevOps Pipelines** along with **Kubernetes service meshes** (e.g., Istio) to perform safe and controlled application rollouts.

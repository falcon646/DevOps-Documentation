### **Azure Administrator Inter-Site Connectivity Module (AZ-104)**  

This module covers the fundamentals of managing and interconnecting various networking components in **Microsoft Azure**. The focus is on two key learning objectives:  

#### **1. Configuring Virtual Network (VNet) Peering**  
VNet peering enables the seamless connection of two Azure **Virtual Networks (VNets)**, allowing resources within them to communicate efficiently over the **Microsoft backbone network**. This approach eliminates the need for external internet routing, providing:  
- **Low-latency, high-bandwidth communication** between VNets.  
- **Cross-region connectivity**, if using **Global VNet Peering**.  
- **Secure and private communication** without traversing the public internet.  

Additionally, the module covers hybrid networking scenarios involving **VPN Gateway**, including:  
- **Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN** – Connecting on-premises networks to Azure.  
- **Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN** – Enabling remote users to securely connect to Azure resources.  

#### **2. Configuring Network Routing and Endpoints**  
This section explores the **Azure networking architecture**, covering essential components such as:  
- **Private Endpoints** – Securely connecting services to a VNet.  
- **Service Endpoints** – Allowing secure access to Azure services from a VNet.  
- **Route Tables** – Defining custom routing rules for traffic control.  

By the end of this module, learners will have a solid understanding of **Azure inter-site connectivity**, enabling them to design and manage a **robust, scalable, and secure networking environment** in Azure.

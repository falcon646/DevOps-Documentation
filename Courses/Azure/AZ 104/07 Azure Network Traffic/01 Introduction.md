# **Administering Network Traffic in Azure**  

This module covers the complexities of network management within **Azure**, focusing on key topics such as **load balancing, traffic routing, and network monitoring**.



### **1. Configuring Azure Load Balancer**  
- Azure Load Balancer ensures **high availability** and **resilience** by distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.  
- Key concepts include:  
  - **Load Balancing Rules** – Define how incoming traffic is distributed.  
  - **Session Persistence** – Maintains user sessions across requests for a seamless experience.  



### **2. Configuring Azure Application Gateway**  
- An **application-level load balancer** that offers **advanced routing** capabilities.  
- Key components:  
  - **Routing Rules** – Control how requests are forwarded to backend servers.  
  - **Security Features** – Protects applications with features like **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.  
  - **Performance Optimization** – Ensures efficient handling of web traffic.  



### **3. Monitoring with Network Watcher**  
- A tool for **monitoring**, **diagnosing**, and **troubleshooting** network traffic in Azure.  
- Helps in:  
  - **Analyzing network communication** between resources.  
  - **Diagnosing connectivity issues** with flow logs and traffic analytics.  
  - **Ensuring compliance** with security rules and policies.  



### **Next Step**  
The module begins with configuring the **Azure Load Balancer**, covering its core functionalities and implementation.

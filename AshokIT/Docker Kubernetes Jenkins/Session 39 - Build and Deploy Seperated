CI : continousintegration (build)
    - clone
    - maven build
    - create docker img
    - push image to hub
    - trigger CD job

CD : continous deleviery (deploy)
    - git clone (for the manifest files etc)
    - deploy to kubernetes/server


Note : once te build job is completed it should automatically trigger the deploy job


Step 1 . Create CI job
    - add script for the folowing tasks (same as of session 38)
        - clone
        - maven build
        - create docker img
        - push image to hub
        - trigger CD job
            steps :
                - open pipeline syntax generator - select "build a job" from drop down
                - fill the name of the job you want to trigger in the "project to build" feild
                - generate the script and copt it -> scrit will be line -> build '<name of job>'
                - add this script in a new stage after the push to hub stage

                stage ("Trigger Deploy job"){
                    steps {
                        build '<name of job>'
                    }
                }




step 2 : Create CD job
    - git clone (for the manifest files etc)

    stage ("Deploy to kubernetes") {
        steps {
            sh "kubectl delete deploy <deploy_name>"
            sh "kubectl apply -f new-deploy.yml"
        }
    }

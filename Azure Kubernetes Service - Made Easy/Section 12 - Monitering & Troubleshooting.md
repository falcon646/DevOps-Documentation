### Azure Activity Logs & Azure Moniter
- The Activity Logs feature in Azure provides visibility into all actions taken and modifications made within an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource.
- Activity Logs record administrative operations and events such as resource creation, deletion, and updating.
- These logs are stored and analyzed using Azure Monitor, which gathers data from various sources including Azure resources, apps, and infrastructures.
- **Availability** : Activity logs are available for the entire AKS cluster or for specific resources that are part of the cluster's infrastructure.
- **Retention and Costs**: Events from activity logs are retained in Azure for 90 days before being erased, regardless of volume.
    - There is no fee for storing these entries during the 90-day retention period.
    - For extended functionality, such as longer retention, users can set a diagnostic setting on the resource and route entries to another location.

**Uses of Activity Logs**
- Tracking resource changes
- Diagnosing problems
- Auditing compliance
- Performing trend analysis on usage and performance

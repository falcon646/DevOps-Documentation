### **Using `terraform apply` with `-auto-approve`**

In Terraform, the **`terraform apply`** command is used to apply the changes defined in your Terraform configuration to your infrastructure. By default, when you run `terraform apply`, Terraform shows a preview of the changes it will make (the **execution plan**) and asks for confirmation before proceeding.

When you run `terraform apply` without the **`-auto-approve`** option, Terraform will:
1. Show the execution plan.
2. Prompt you to confirm whether you want to apply the changes.
   
```bash
terraform apply
```

At this point, Terraform will ask for confirmation:
```plaintext
Do you want to perform these actions? 
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # (your resource details here)
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Enter a value: 
```

You need to type `yes` to approve the changes or `no` to cancel the operation.

**With Auto-Approval (`-auto-approve`)** : If you want to skip the confirmation prompt and apply the changes immediately, you can use the **`-auto-approve`** option. This makes Terraform apply the changes without asking for any confirmation.

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This will:
1. Skip the confirmation prompt.
2. Automatically apply the execution plan and make the changes.

This is useful when you want to automate the process of applying changes without manual intervention (e.g., in CI/CD pipelines or when running Terraform in a fully automated environment).

**Simillary you can use `terraform destroy -auto-approve`**

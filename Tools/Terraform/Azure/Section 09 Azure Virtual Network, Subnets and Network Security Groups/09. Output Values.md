####  Outputs values

Output values make information about your infrastructure available on the command line, and can expose information for other Terraform configurations to use. Output values are similar to return values in programming languages. Output values have several uses:
- A child module can use outputs to expose a subset of its resource attributes to a parent module.
- A root module can use outputs to print certain values in the CLI output after running `terraform apply`.
- When using remote state, root module outputs can be accessed by other configurations via a terraform_remote_state data source.
- Resource instances managed by Terraform each export attributes whose values can be used elsewhere in configuration. Output values are a way to expose some of that information to the user of your module.
- **Remote State Data Source:**  
   - When using remote state data sources, outputs allow one project to access resource information from another project. This is essential when you distribute your configurations across multiple Terraform projects. For example, you might have:
     - **Project One:** Networking resources (e.g., Virtual Network)
     - **Project Two:** Compute instances for a specific business unit
     - **Project Three:** Global load balancing resources (e.g., Traffic Managers, Front Doors)
  - In such cases, you might need to reference the virtual network created in Project One when configuring network interfaces in Project Two. Outputs from Project One can be accessed using Terraform's remote state data source.

For now, we will implement basic output values for the virtual network and display them in the CLI during `terraform apply`.

Output values in Terraform are defined in a top-level `output` block. They allow you to print or export information about your resources after a successful `terraform apply`.

#### Defining Virtual Network Output Values
- **c9-vnet-output.tf**
- **Virtual Network Name Output:**
   - Create a top-level `output` block.
   - Provide a descriptive name and a description.
   - Set the value to reference the name attribute from the virtual network resource.
   ```hcl
   output "vnet_name" {
     description = "The name of the virtual network."
     value       = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
   }
   ```
   - here, `azurerm_virtual_network.vnet` is the resource reference, and `.name` is the attribute that provides the virtual network name.  
   *Note:* In Terraform, resource documentation provides both argument references (inputs) and attribute references (outputs), so you can reference both types in output blocks.
- **Virtual Network ID Output:** 
   - Similarly, create another output for the virtual network ID.
   - The ID is typically only available after the resource is created, making it an attribute reference.
   ```hcl
   output "vnet_id" {
     description = "The ID of the virtual network."
     value       = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.id
   }
   ```
- **Subnet and NSG Output Values** : You will also create outputs for subnets and network security groups. 
```hcl
output "web_subnet_name" {
  description = "The name of the web subnet."
  value       = azurerm_subnet.web_subnet.name
}

output "web_subnet_id" {
  description = "The ID of the web subnet."
  value       = azurerm_subnet.web_subnet.id
}
```

Similarly, for the network security group associated with the web subnet:

```hcl
output "web_subnet_nsg_name" {
  description = "The name of the web subnet NSG."
  value       = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.name
}

output "web_subnet_nsg_id" {
  description = "The ID of the web subnet NSG."
  value       = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.id
}
```

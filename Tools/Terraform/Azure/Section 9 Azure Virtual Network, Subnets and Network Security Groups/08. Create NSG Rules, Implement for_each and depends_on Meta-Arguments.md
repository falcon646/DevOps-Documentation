**NSG Rules**
- We will create a  security rule to allowing inbound request at **Port 22**.
```json
resource "network_security_rule" ""{
    resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
    network_security_group_name = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.name
    name                        = "Rule-Port-22"
    priority                    = 100
    direction                   = "Inbound"
    access                      = "Allow"
    protocol                    = "Tcp"
    source_port_range           = "*"
    destination_port_range      = "22"
    source_address_prefix       = "*"
    destination_address_prefix  = "*"
}
```
The problem with the above approah is that  there are additional ports that need to be configured, such as 80, 443 ,8080 , 8082 etc
- Manually defining separate security rule resources for each port would lead to code duplication and maintenance complexity. Instead of writing multiple individual rules, **Terraform's `for_each` meta-argument** can be leveraged.
- Using `for_each` in Terraform
If a resource block includes a `for_each` argument with a **map** or **set of strings**, Terraform will create one instance for each member of that set.
- Each instance is independently managed, meaning it can be created, updated, or destroyed separately. The key advantage here is that Terraform dynamically generates security rule resources without manually defining them.
- Implementing `for_each` with a Map
To avoid redundancy, a **local variable** (locals block) can be used to define the required ports along with their priority values in a **map**:
```hcl
locals {
  web_inbound_ports_map = {
    100 : 80,
    110 : 443,
    120 : 22
  }
}
```
- **Note :** If a map key starts with a number (e.g., `100`, `110`), **use a colon (`:`) instead of an equals sign (`=`) to define key-value pairs**. Otherwise, Terraform will throw a syntax error.
- Applying `for_each` in the Security Rule Resource . With the map defined in the `locals` block, the `for_each` argument can be used within the security rule resource to dynamically create multiple rules:
```json
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "web_nsg_rule_inbound" {
  for_each = web_inbound_ports_map

  name                        = "Rule-port-${each.value}"
  priority                    = each.key
  direction                   = "Inbound"
  access                      = "Allow"
  protocol                    = "Tcp"
  source_port_range           = "*"
  destination_port_range      = each.value
  source_address_prefix       = "*"
  destination_address_prefix  = "*"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
  network_security_group_name = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.name
}
```

When associating a **Network Security Group (NSG)** with a **Subnet**, Terraform **disassociates** the NSG first and then **reassociates** it after applying changes.  
- If multiple **NSG rules** are being created dynamically using `for_each`, the association process may get caught in an **infinite loop** due to a bug in the **AzureRM provider**.  
- This issue arises because **NSG creation is slow** and appears to be **serialized** rather than parallelized.
- Using **inline security rules** instead of separate NSG rule resources can sometimes mitigate this issue.  
- However, if individual security rules are needed, Terraform provides a way to **ensure correct resource creation order** using the `depends_on` meta-argument.

**Using `depends_on` to Prevent Looping Issues**

Terraformâ€™s **`depends_on` meta-argument** helps explicitly define dependencies between resources that Terraform **cannot infer automatically**.  
- **How `depends_on` Works**
    - Ensures that a resource (`B`) **only starts creation after** another resource (`A`) has been fully created.  
    - This is particularly useful when working with **hidden dependencies** that Terraform does not detect on its own.

**Applying `depends_on` in NSG Association**

To avoid potential looping or race conditions, the **NSG association** should explicitly depend on the **NSG and security rules** using `depends_on`:

```json
resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "web_subnet_nsg_association"{
    subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.websubnet.id
    network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.id

    depends_on = [
        azurerm_network_security_rule.web_nsg_rule_inbound
    ]
}
```
- **Why `depends_on` Is Necessary here**
    - **Prevents Terraform from trying to associate the NSG before it is fully created.**  
    - **Ensures all security rules are created before NSG association happens.**  
    - **Prevents potential infinite loops caused by re-association issues in AzureRM provider.**


- Similarlly we will create nsg and rule for app , db and bastion subnet and assoocciate it to respective subnets

    - **c8-app_subnet_nsg_association.tf** 
    - **c8-db_subnet_nsg_association.tf** 
    - **c8-bastion_subnet_nsg_association.tf**

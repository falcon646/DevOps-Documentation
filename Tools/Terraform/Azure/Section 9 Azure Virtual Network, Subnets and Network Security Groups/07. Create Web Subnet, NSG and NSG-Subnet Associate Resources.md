As part of the previous step, we have already created the input variables for the Virtual Network and the related resources. Now, we are going to create the web tier subnet and its associated Network Security Group (NSG).
- **Web Tier Subnet**: This resource will define the web tier subnet within the Azure Virtual Network.
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**: This resource will define the network security rules for the web tier subnet. 
- **associate NSG with subnet**: The key thing to remember here is that the Network Security Group (NSG) for the web tier subnet needs to be associated with the subnet itself. There will be an additional resource for this called associate NSG with subnet
- **NSG rules**: For the NSG, we can define security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. These rules specify which ports need to be open for incoming and outgoing traffic. There are two ways to define these rules:
    - **Inline definition**: We can define the security rules directly within the Network Security Group using the `security_rule` block.
    - **Separate resources**: We can create multiple rule resources separately and reference them within the NSG.

**web subnet** 
```json
# web subnet
resource "azurerm_subnet" "websubnet" {
    name = "${azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name}-${var.web_subnet_name}"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_greoup.myrg.name
    virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
    address_prefixes = var.web_subnet_address
}
```

**Network Security Group** 
```json
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "web_subnet_nsg"  {
    name = "${azurerm_subnet.websubnet.name}-nsg"
    location = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
}
```

**Associate NSG and websubnet** 
```json
resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "web_subnet_nsg_association"{
    subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.websubnet.id
    network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.web_subnet_nsg.id

    // explained in the next lecture
    depends_on = [
        azurerm_network_security_rule.web_nsg_rule_inbound
    ]
}
```

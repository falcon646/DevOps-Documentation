**Step 4: Executing the configuration**
- Run `terraform init`
- We obsereve that the lock file `.terraform.lock.hcl` got created. Below are its content
```json
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm" {
  version     = "1.44.0"
  constraints = "1.44.0"
  hashes = [ xxxx  ]
}
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random" {
  version     = "3.6.3"
  constraints = "3.6.3"
  hashes = [ xxxx  ]
}
```
- We can observe that the versions are sepcified here


**Step 5: Updating the versions**
Now , we will update the azurerm version to >=4.0
```json
  required_providers{
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">=4.0"
    }
```
- Now when we try to run `terraform init` , we will get an error 
    - This is because the the `.terraform.lock.hcl` has locked the versopn of azurerm to be 1.44. If you change the version to anything else in the configuration file , it would throw and error
```bash
│ Error: Failed to query available provider packages
│ Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider hashicorp/azurerm: locked provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm 1.44.0 does not match configured version constraint >= 4.0.0; must use terraform init -upgrade to allow selection of new versions
│ To see which modules are currently depending on hashicorp/azurerm and what versions are specified, run the following command: 
│     terraform providers    
```
- To forcefully upgrade the version to the one which we mentioned , we need to use the --upgrade option wityh the init command `terraform init --upgrade`   
    - When you run `terraform init --upgrade` , it will update the lock file to use the version you specified.
    - But when you run `terraform validate` , it would again throw and error , because azurerm version >4.0 does not use the attribute `  # account_encryption_source = "Microsoft.Storage"` and also , ikt requires the `feature {}` block as well. It resolve this issue you need to remove the attribute   and add the features block
```json
    provider "azurerm" {
        features {
            
        }
        subscription_id = "8a58d831-ec06-4123-aecf-cdbf9b7297ee"
    }
    resource "azurerm_storage_account" "mysa"{
        name = "mysa${random_string.myrandom.id}"
        resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg1.name
        location = azurerm_resource_group.myrg1.location
        account_tier = "Standard"
        account_replication_type = "GRS"
        // account_encryption_source = "Microsoft.Storage"
    }
```

**This way , the lock file helped us from breaking our infra by locking the version** 

### Summary
- Locking Provider Versions: The .terraform.lock.hcl file ensures consistency and prevents unintended upgrades.
- Manual Upgrades: Terraform will not upgrade providers automatically unless terraform init -upgrade is explicitly run.

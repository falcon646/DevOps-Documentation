### **Overview of the Implementation**
The goal is to:
- Use **Terraform Azure provider v1.44.0** to create an **Azure storage container**.
- Upgrade the provider to **v2.64.0** and observe the impact.
- Understand how the **lock file prevents version mismatches** and infrastructure failures.

---
**Step 0: Defining Required Providers**
- Define **AzureRM provider** with version **1.44.0**.
- Define **random provider** with version **>=3.0**.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "1.44.0"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = ">=3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "xxxx-xxxx"
}

provider "random" {}
```
- ðŸ“Œ **Key Observations**:
    - The **AzureRM provider** is set to **1.44.0** (older version).
    - **Features block is removed** because it **does not exist in v1.x**.
    - The **random provider** is added for generating a unique storage name.


**Step 1: Create the Azure Resource Group** named `myrg1`** in the **East US** region.
```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myrg1" {
  name     = "myrg1"
  location = "East US"
}
```

**Step 2: Generate a Random String for the Storage Account** , To ensure a unique **storage account name**, we use the `random_string` resource. Beloe resource generates a **16-character** random string **without special or uppercase characters**.

```hcl
resource "random_string" "myrandom" {
  length  = 16
  special = false
  upper   = false
}
```
**Step 3: Initialize Terraform and Observe the Lock File**
Run:
```bash
terraform init
```
- Terraform downloads **AzureRM v1.44.0** and **Random v3.x**.
- Creates `.terraform.lock.hcl` to store the provider versions and checksum hashes.

---

#### **Step 4: Upgrade the Provider to v2.64.0**
Attempt to upgrade the provider:
```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```
**Expected Outcome**:
- **Without the lock file**, Terraform **upgrades to v2.64.0**.
- **With the lock file**, Terraform **keeps v1.44.0**.

---

### **3. Understanding the Impact**
| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **With the Lock File** | Terraform **keeps using v1.44.0**, ensuring infrastructure stability. |
| **Without the Lock File** | Terraform upgrades to **v2.64.0**, potentially causing compatibility issues. |
| **Force Upgrade (`-upgrade` flag)** | Terraform **overrides the lock file** and upgrades the provider, potentially breaking infrastructure. |

---

### **4. Key Learnings**
âœ” **The lock file prevents unintended provider upgrades** and ensures **consistent deployments**.  
âœ” **If removed, Terraform fetches the latest compatible version**, which may introduce breaking changes.  
âœ” **Always commit `.terraform.lock.hcl`** to **Git** for team-wide consistency.

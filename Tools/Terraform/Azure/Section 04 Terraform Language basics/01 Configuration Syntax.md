## **Terraform Configuration Files**  

Terraform configurations consist of files with a **.tf** extension. These files store Terraform code in **plain text** format.  
- Additionally, Terraform supports a **JSON-based variant** with a **.tf.json** extension. However, **99.99% of users prefer the .tf format**, while the JSON format is used only in rare cases by those proficient in JSON.  
- Terraform configuration files are also referred to as:  
    - **Terraform manifests**  
    - **Terraform configuration files**  
    - **tf configs (short for Terraform configurations)**  
- These files reside within the **Terraform working directory**, which serves as the **execution environment** for Terraform commands. Any Terraform-related tasks—writing code, running commands, or managing resources—are performed within this directory.  

## **Terraform Configuration Syntax**  
Terraform follows a structured syntax consisting of:  
- **Blocks**  
- **Arguments**  
- **Identifiers**  
- **Comments**  


#### **Terraform Block Structure**  
Terraform configurations are built using **blocks**, which define infrastructure resources and settings. Each block follows a general template:  

```hcl
<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {  
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION>  # Argument  
}
```
**Components of a Terraform Block**  

1. **Block Type**: Defines the purpose of the block.Examples: **resource, variable, provider, data source, output**  

2. **Block Labels**: Provide additional identifiers based on the block type.  
   - **Resource blocks** typically have **two labels** (resource type and resource name).  
   - **Variable blocks** usually have **one label** (variable name).  

3. **Arguments**: Define properties inside a block. Example: `name = "myrg-1"`  

4. **Identifiers and Expressions**:  
   - **Argument Name (Identifier)**: Left-hand side of the argument (`name`, `location`).  
   - **Argument Value (Expression)**: Right-hand side of the argument (`"East US"`, `azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location`).  
   - Expressions can reference values from other resources, allowing dynamic configuration.

**Terraform Comments**  : Terraform supports **two types of comments**:  

- **Single-line Comments:**  
   - Recommended: `# This is a single-line comment`  
   - Alternative (for auto-generated code): `// This is another single-line comment`  

- **Multi-line Comments:**  
   ```t
   /*
   This is a 
   multi-line comment.
   */
   ```

### **Practical Demonstration of Resource Behaviors in Terraform**

1. **Terraform Initialization (`terraform init`)**:
   - The command initializes the working directory, sets up the backend for storing the state file, and downloads the necessary provider plugins. This is the first step to get Terraform ready to work with your configuration.

2. **Terraform Validation (`terraform validate`)**:
   - This command checks the syntax and structure of the Terraform configuration files to ensure they are correctly written. It's an essential step to catch any obvious configuration errors before running further commands.
   
3. **Terraform Plan (`terraform plan`)**:
   - The `terraform plan` command shows what Terraform will do based on the current configuration. It outlines the **create**, **update**, or **destroy** actions.
   - In this case, Terraform plans to create five resources:
     - **Virtual Network**
     - **Subnet**
     - **Public IP**
     - **Network Interface**
     - **Resource Group**
   - All these resources will be created because, in this example, there are no existing resources in the cloud or state file yet, so the **"Create Resource"** behavior is triggered.

4. **Terraform Apply (`terraform apply -auto-approve`)**:
   - Running `terraform apply` with `-auto-approve` (for convenience) applies the changes outlined in the plan. In a production environment, it's recommended to review and confirm the plan before applying.
   - Terraform creates the resources:
     - **Resource Group** (`myrg-1`)
     - **Virtual Network**
     - **Public IP**
     - **Subnet**
     - **Network Interface**
   
5. **Resource Verification**:
   - After `terraform apply` completes, the resources are verified in the cloud environment:
     - The **resource group** `myrg-1` is created.
     - Inside the **virtual network**, the subnet `mysubnet-1` is created.
     - The **network interface** `vmnic` is created and associated with the public IP.

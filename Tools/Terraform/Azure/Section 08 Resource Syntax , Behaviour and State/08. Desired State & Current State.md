
### Understanding Terraform State

Terraform uses the concept of **desired state** and **current state** to manage infrastructure efficiently. 

**Desired State**
- The desired state represents the infrastructure configuration as defined in Terraform manifest files (`*.tf` files).
- It contains all the resource configurations that the user wants to provision in the cloud.
- This state is static and does not change until explicitly modified in the Terraform configuration files.

**Current State**
- The current state represents the actual, real-world resources that exist in the cloud.
- It includes all deployed infrastructure, such as virtual networks, subnets, resource groups, and public IPs.
- The details of the current state are stored in the `terraform.tfstate` file.

### **Module: Administering Azure Resources**  

With a solid understanding of **Azureâ€™s hierarchical structure**, including **management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups**, the next step is to focus on **active resource management**. This module covers the essential skills required to **administer Azure resources efficiently**.  



### **Learning Objectives**  
The module is divided into **two primary sections**, each focusing on different aspects of **resource management and configuration**.  

#### **1. Configuring Azure with Administrator Tools**  
- This section provides a **comparative analysis of various administrator tools** used in Azure.  
- The objective is to enable selection of **the most appropriate tool** based on the specific management requirements of Azure resources.  

#### **2. Configuring Resources with ARM Templates**  
This section explores **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** concepts, including:  

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):**  
  - The **deployment and management layer** for Azure resources.  
  - Ensures consistent provisioning, configuration, and governance.  

- **ARM Templates:**  
  - Define **infrastructure and configurations** in a **declarative and repeatable** manner.  
  - Enable **automation** of resource deployment.  

- **ARM Template Structure:**  
  - Provides a **blueprint** for defining **Azure resources and dependencies**.  
  - Helps in **standardizing infrastructure deployment**.  

- **Bicep:**  
  - A **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed to **simplify** ARM templates.  
  - Enhances **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices** by improving readability and reducing complexity.

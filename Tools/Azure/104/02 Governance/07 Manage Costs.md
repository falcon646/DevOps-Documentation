    - Reports can be shared with **business stakeholders** who need financial insights without accessing the Azure portal.  


### **Setting Up Budgets in Azure Cost Management**  

Azure Cost Management allows users to set **budgets** to monitor and control cloud spending effectively. By creating budgets, organizations can track specific resource costs, set spending limits, and configure alerts to avoid exceeding financial thresholds.  

**Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Budget**  

- **1. Accessing Budgets in Azure**  
1. Open **Azure Portal**.  
2. Navigate to **Cost Management** → **Budgets**.  
3. Click on **Create a Budget**.  

- **2. Defining the Budget Scope**  
    - The default scope applies to the **entire subscription**.  
    - If a budget is needed for a **specific resource type** (e.g., Virtual Machines), filters must be applied.  
    - Example:  
    - To track Virtual Machine costs, add a **filter** for the **meter category** as **Virtual Machines**.  
    - The system will display **historical usage trends** to help define an appropriate budget.  

- **3. Configuring Budget Details**  
    - Provide a **unique name** (e.g., `VM-Budget`).  
    - Define the **reset period** (e.g., **Monthly**).  
    - Set the **budget duration** (e.g., **from December 20, 2023, to 2025**).  
    - Enter the **budget amount** (e.g., **$300**):  
    - A **red line** appears in the graph, indicating the spending limit.  
    - If historical spending **exceeds** this limit, optimization may be needed.  
    - The system also displays **forecasted spending** for the next six months.  
    - Adjust the budget as needed (e.g., increasing to **$330** if forecasts indicate a need for higher limits).  

- **4. Setting Up Budget Alerts**  
    - Alerts notify stakeholders when spending **approaches or exceeds** the budget.  
    - Define **alert conditions** (e.g., notify at **80% of budget consumption**).  
    - Attach an **Action Group**, which determines **how notifications are sent**:  
    - **Email alerts** to stakeholders.  
    - **SMS or phone call notifications**.  
    - **Automation triggers** (e.g., scaling down resources).  
    - Multiple **thresholds** can be configured to notify different teams at different spending levels.  
    - **Additional alert recipients** can be added to receive notifications regardless of thresholds.  


### **Cost-Saving Strategies in Azure**

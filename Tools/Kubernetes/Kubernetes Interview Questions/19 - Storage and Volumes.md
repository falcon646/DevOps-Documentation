<ol><li><p><strong>What are Volumes in Kubernetes and Why are They Important?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Volumes in Kubernetes are used for storing data and state across container restarts within the same pod. They are important because containers are ephemeral and typically have a filesystem that does not persist beyond the container’s lifecycle. Kubernetes volumes support many storage backends and help in keeping data persistent, sharing data between containers in a pod, and storing configuration or secrets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Different Types of Volumes in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes supports several types of volumes, like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>emptyDir</strong>: A simple empty directory used for storing transient data.</p></li><li><p><strong>hostPath</strong>: Used for mounting directories from the host node’s filesystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>nfs</strong>: An NFS (Network File System) mounted into the pod.</p></li><li><p><strong>persistentVolumeClaim</strong>: A reference to a Persistent Volume used for persistent storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>configMap</strong>, <strong>secret</strong>, <strong>downwardAPI</strong>: Special types of volumes used for exposing certain Kubernetes resources and cluster information to the pod.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a Persistent Volume (PV) and a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It specifies size, and access modes, and is matched with a PV. PVs and PVCs support volumes that persist beyond the lifecycle of individual pods.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Handle Dynamic Volume Provisioning?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dynamic volume provisioning allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. This is done using StorageClasses, which are templates describing how a volume should be created. When a PVC is created and requests a specific StorageClass, a new volume is created according to the template and bound to the PVC.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are StorageClasses in Kubernetes? How Do They Work?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> StorageClasses in Kubernetes provide a way to describe different “classes” of storage. They allow administrators to define various types of storage (like SSDs, HDDs, or network storage) with different characteristics and let users select a storage class through PVCs. The StorageClass defines the provisioner, parameters, and reclaimPolicy.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can You Explain How to Share Data Between Containers in a Pod?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Data can be shared between containers within the same pod using volumes. A common type of volume for this purpose is <code><strong>emptyDir</strong></code>. An <code><strong>emptyDir</strong></code> volume is created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as that pod is running. Containers in the pod can read and write the same files in the <code><strong>emptyDir</strong></code> volume.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Configure a Pod to Use a PVC?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> To configure a pod to use a PVC, you must specify the PVC in the pod’s manifest file. The PVC is mounted as a volume inside the container. In the pod definition, you reference the PVC by name under the <code><strong>volumes</strong></code> section, and then specify the mount path within the container under the <code><strong>volumeMounts</strong></code> section.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a Reclaim Policy in Kubernetes Storage?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Reclaim Policy in Kubernetes determines what happens to a Persistent Volume when the PVC is released. The options are <code><strong>Retain</strong></code> (keeping the data and volume intact), <code><strong>Delete</strong></code> (deleting both the PV and the associated storage in the backend), and <code><strong>Recycle</strong></code> (deprecated, which removes data and makes the volume available again for a new claim).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Discuss Access Modes in Kubernetes Storage.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Access modes in Kubernetes define how a Persistent Volume can be accessed from a node. The primary access modes are <code><strong>ReadWriteOnce</strong></code> (volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node), <code><strong>ReadOnlyMany</strong></code> (volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes), and <code><strong>ReadWriteMany</strong></code> (volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Ensure Data Persistence Across Pod Rescheduling?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes ensures data persistence across pod rescheduling through Persistent Volumes (PVs). A PV exists independently of pod lifecycle, so when a pod is deleted or rescheduled to another node, the data in the PV persists. The PVC ensures that when the pod is rescheduled or recreated, it can reattach to its data stored in the PV.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

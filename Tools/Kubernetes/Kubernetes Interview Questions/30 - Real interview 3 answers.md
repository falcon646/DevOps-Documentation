<ol><li><p><strong>What is a Kubernetes Service and Why is it Important?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Kubernetes Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. It provides a consistent and stable IP address, DNS name, and port and load balances the traffic among the Pods. Services are crucial for managing how clients access your application, as they provide a stable interface to a dynamic set of Pods.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Different Types of Services in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The main types of Services in Kubernetes are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ClusterIP</strong>: Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster, making it only reachable from within the cluster.</p></li><li><p><strong>NodePort</strong>: Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node’s IP, making it accessible from outside the cluster.</p></li><li><p><strong>LoadBalancer</strong>: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.</p></li><li><p><strong>ExternalName</strong>: Maps the Service to an external DNS name.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do Services Discover and Manage Traffic to Pods?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Services discover Pods using label selectors. When you define a Service, you specify a set of labels that match a group of Pods. The Service routes traffic to these Pods using a round-robin algorithm by default. As Pods are created or destroyed, the Service automatically updates the group of Pods it targets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are Kubernetes Namespaces and How Do They Relate to Security?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. From a security perspective, they provide a logical separation of cluster resources, allowing for the implementation of policies, limits, and permissions on a per-namespace basis. This helps in creating a multi-tenant environment with controlled access to resources.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain Role-Based Access Control in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> RBAC in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. It allows administrators to define roles with specific permissions (like read, write, delete) and bind these roles to users, groups, or service accounts. RBAC ensures that users have access only to the resources they need, following the principle of least privilege.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

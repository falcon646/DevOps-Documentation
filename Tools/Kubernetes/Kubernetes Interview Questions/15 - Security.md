<ol><li><p><strong>What are Kubernetes Namespaces and How Do They Relate to Security?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. From a security perspective, they provide a logical separation of cluster resources, allowing for the implementation of policies, limits, and permissions on a per-namespace basis. This helps in creating a multi-tenant environment with controlled access to resources.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> RBAC in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. It allows administrators to define roles with specific permissions (like read, write, delete) and bind these roles to users, groups, or service accounts. RBAC ensures that users have access only to the resources they need, following the principle of least privilege.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a Pod Security Policy (PSP) in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls security-sensitive aspects of the pod specification. PSPs define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be accepted into the system, including privileges, access to host resources, and other security-related aspects. They are crucial for maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do Network Policies Work in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Network policies in Kubernetes enable the definition of rules about which pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They are used to isolate and control the flow of traffic between pods and external services, thereby enhancing the security of the Kubernetes cluster.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the Importance of Secrets Management in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Secrets management in Kubernetes involves securely storing and managing sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Using Kubernetes Secrets, you can control and securely distribute these sensitive data to the applications running in the cluster, without exposing them in your application's code or configuration files.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Certificate Management Work?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes manages TLS certificates for various components to ensure secure communication within the cluster. The Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA) issues certificates for nodes, API server, and other components. Administrators can also manage and rotate these certificates, ensuring that the communication remains secure and that the certificates are always valid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Discuss the Best Practices for Kubernetes Security.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Best practices for Kubernetes security include using RBAC for access control, limiting resource permissions using namespaces, securing cluster networking with network policies, using Pod Security Policies, regularly updating and patching Kubernetes, using secure communication channels, and implementing a strong secrets management strategy. Regular security audits and adherence to security benchmarks like CIS Kubernetes Benchmark are also crucial.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the Role of Container Image Security in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Container image security in Kubernetes involves ensuring that the container images used in the cluster are free from vulnerabilities. This includes scanning images for vulnerabilities, signing images to ensure their integrity, using trusted image registries, and implementing policies to only allow images that meet certain security standards.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Implement Logging and Monitoring for Security in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Implementing logging and monitoring in Kubernetes involves collecting and analyzing logs from various components like the Kubernetes API server, nodes, and containers to detect and respond to security incidents. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana are commonly used for this purpose.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Importance of Compliance and Security Auditing in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compliance and security auditing in Kubernetes involves regularly evaluating the cluster and its components against security standards and best practices. This helps in identifying and mitigating security risks, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations, and maintaining the overall security posture of the Kubernetes environment.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

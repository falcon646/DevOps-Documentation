<ol><li><p><strong>What is AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and its Key Features?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> AKS is Microsoft Azure's managed container orchestration service, based on Kubernetes. Key features include integrated CI/CD experiences, enterprise-grade security and governance, simplified cluster management, automatic scaling, and integration with other Azure services.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) Differ from Other Kubernetes Services?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> EKS is Amazon's managed Kubernetes service. It integrates deeply with AWS services like IAM for authentication, ELB for load balancing, and VPC for networking. EKS stands out for its robustness and seamless integration with AWS's infrastructure, making it a strong choice for businesses deeply invested in AWS.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are the Advantages of Using GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> GKE, Google's Kubernetes service, offers a fully managed experience with automated provisioning, repairs, and scaling. Notable advantages include its strong integration with Google Cloud services, advanced cluster management features, robust security, and a global container registry.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can You Migrate Existing Kubernetes Clusters to AKS, EKS, or GKE? How?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, you can migrate existing Kubernetes clusters to these managed services. The process typically involves setting up a new cluster in the service (AKS, EKS, or GKE), configuring networking, storage, and other cloud-specific settings, and then migrating your workloads and data. Tools like <code><strong>kube-migrate</strong></code> or cloud provider-specific migration tools can facilitate this process.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Implement High Availability in AKS, EKS, and GKE?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> High availability in these services involves multi-zone cluster configurations and automatic replication and failover mechanisms. AKS, EKS, and GKE all support cluster deployment across multiple availability zones, ensuring resilience and high availability of Kubernetes workloads.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are the Security Features Available in AKS, EKS, and GKE?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> All three services offer robust security features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: Integrates with Azure Active Directory and offers network policies, Azure Policy integrations, and security monitoring with Azure Security Center.</p></li><li><p><strong>EKS</strong>: Integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), supports VPC networking, and offers encryption with AWS KMS.</p></li><li><p><strong>GKE</strong>: Offers integrated Google Cloud IAM, uses Container-Optimized OS for nodes, and provides built-in network policies and Node auto-upgrade features.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Auto-scaling Work in AKS, EKS, and GKE?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Auto-scaling in these services allows automatic resizing of clusters based on workload:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: Uses Azureâ€™s VM scale sets for node auto-scaling.</p></li><li><p><strong>EKS</strong>: Utilizes AWS Auto Scaling groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>GKE</strong>: Offers cluster autoscaler and vertical pod autoscaling.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Pricing Models of AKS, EKS, and GKE.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: Does not charge for the Kubernetes management service; you pay only for the VMs, storage, and networking resources consumed.</p></li><li><p><strong>EKS</strong>: Charges a management fee for each Kubernetes cluster, plus the resources (like EC2 instances) used.</p></li><li><p><strong>GKE</strong>: Charges a cluster management fee and for the resources used. Offers a free tier for a single-zone cluster with limited resources.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are the Networking Capabilities of AKS, EKS, and GKE?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> All three services offer advanced networking capabilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: Integrates with Azure Virtual Network, offering network policies, load balancing, and network isolation.</p></li><li><p><strong>EKS</strong>: Supports Amazon VPC for networking, allowing detailed control over network settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>GKE</strong>: Integrates with Google Cloud VPC, offering powerful network policies and load balancing features.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Monitor and Log Kubernetes Clusters in AKS, EKS, and GKE?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>AKS</strong>: Integrates with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring and logging.</p></li><li><p><strong>EKS</strong>: Can be monitored with Amazon CloudWatch and integrates with AWS CloudTrail for logging.</p></li><li><p><strong>GKE</strong>: Offers integrated logging and monitoring with Stackdriver (Operations).</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>

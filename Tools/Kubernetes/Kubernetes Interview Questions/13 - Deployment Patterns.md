<ol><li><p><strong>What is a Kubernetes Deployment and How Does it Work?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Kubernetes Deployment is an API object that manages the creation and updating of ReplicaSets and Pods. It allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pods, and the way to update them, among other aspects. Deployments use a ReplicaSet to manage the pods. When you update a Deployment, it triggers a rollout, which creates a new ReplicaSet and scales it up, while scaling down the old one.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain Blue/Green Deployment Pattern in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Blue/Green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical environments, only one of which (Blue) serves live production traffic. For a new release, the new version (Green) is deployed alongside the Blue. After testing the Green environment, traffic is switched over. If issues arise, traffic can be switched back to Blue. Kubernetes facilitates this pattern through services that redirect network traffic to different deployments.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Describe the Canary Deployment Pattern in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Canary deployment involves rolling out a new version of an application gradually to a subset of users to ensure stability before a full rollout. In Kubernetes, this can be achieved by deploying a new version of the application (canary version) and slowly routing a small percentage of traffic to it. Based on the feedback and performance, the traffic is gradually increased until the canary version is serving all the traffic.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a Rolling Update in Kubernetes, and How is it Performed?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Rolling Update is the default strategy to update the running version of your app in Kubernetes. It gradually replaces instances of the old version of an application with the new one. This is managed by the Deployment controller in Kubernetes. It ensures that only a certain number of pods are taken down and new ones are brought up simultaneously, thus maintaining application availability.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Implement A/B Testing in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A/B testing in Kubernetes involves deploying two versions of an application (A and B), then directing a certain percentage of user traffic to version B while the rest continue to use version A. This is often implemented using advanced routing capabilities provided by an ingress controller or a service mesh like Istio, which allows you to route requests based on different criteria.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes and How is it Different from a Deployment?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> StatefulSet is a Kubernetes workload API object used for managing stateful applications. It is similar to a Deployment in that it manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. However, unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Shadow Deployment Pattern in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Shadow deployment is a pattern where the incoming traffic is duplicated and sent to both the old and new versions of the application. The new version (shadow) processes the traffic in parallel without affecting the real user responses. This allows you to observe the behavior of the new version under real-world conditions without any risk to the actual application. Kubernetes can implement this pattern with service meshes like Istio or Linkerd.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are Kubernetes Jobs and CronJobs?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes Jobs are a way to run a workload (pod) that does not require a persistent identity or long-term storage. It creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. CronJobs, on the other hand, are similar to Jobs but allow you to schedule the execution of jobs at specific times or intervals. They are useful for tasks like backups, report generation, and other periodic tasks.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Handle Rolling Back a Deployment?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes allows you to roll back to an earlier deployment revision if the current state is not stable. This is achieved using the <code><strong>kubectl rollout undo</strong></code> command. Kubernetes keeps a history of changes made to a Deployment, and when a rollback is triggered, it refers to this history and updates the Deployment to a previous version.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the Declarative Approach in Kubernetes Deployments?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The declarative approach in Kubernetes involves defining the desired state of the application in YAML or JSON configuration files, and then using Kubernetes to achieve that state. Rather than specifying a series of steps to be executed, you specify the desired state and let Kubernetes handle the process to achieve that state. This approach is central to Kubernetes and allows for greater scalability and ease of management.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

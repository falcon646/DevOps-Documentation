<ol><li><p><strong>What is a Kubernetes Deployment and How Does it Work?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Kubernetes Deployment is an API object that provides declarative updates to applications. It allows you to describe an application’s desired state, such as which container images to use and the number of pod replicas. The Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate, managing the rollout of updated application instances and, if necessary, rolling back to an earlier deployment version.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Update a Deployment in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> To update a Deployment in Kubernetes, you typically update the Deployment’s pod template, such as changing the container image. Kubernetes then performs a rolling update, where it gradually replaces old pods with new ones. The rate of replacement and the number of pods running the old and new version can be controlled through the Deployment configuration.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain Rolling Updates and Rollbacks in Kubernetes Deployments.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rolling updates are the default strategy for updating a Deployment. During a rolling update, Kubernetes incrementally updates pod instances with new ones. If an issue is detected, you can roll back a Deployment to a previous version. Rollbacks can be triggered using <code><strong>kubectl</strong></code> commands, and Kubernetes will revert the Deployment to the previously known stable state.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Handle Deployment Scaling?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes scales Deployments by adjusting the number of replicas – the number of Pod instances running for that Deployment. This can be done manually using commands like <code><strong>kubectl scale</strong></code>, or automatically using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers that adjust the number of replicas based on CPU usage or other select metrics.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What Happens to Deployments When a Node Fails?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> When a node fails, the pods on that node become unavailable. The Deployment controller notices this and creates new pods on other available nodes to replace the ones that were running on the failed node. This ensures that the Deployment maintains the desired number of replicas.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Monitor the Status of a Kubernetes Deployment?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The status of a Kubernetes Deployment can be monitored using <code><strong>kubectl</strong></code> commands like <code><strong>kubectl get deployments</strong></code> to check the deployment status, <code><strong>kubectl describe deployment</strong></code> to get detailed information, and <code><strong>kubectl rollout status</strong></code> to watch the status of a deployment update.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can You Explain the Concept of 'Desired State' in Kubernetes Deployments?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'desired state' in Kubernetes Deployments refers to the state described in the Deployment’s configuration. This includes aspects like the number of replicas, container images, and resource limits. Kubernetes continuously works to ensure that the actual state of the Deployment matches this desired state.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the Significance of ReplicaSets in Kubernetes Deployments?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A ReplicaSet is the next-generation ReplicationController. It ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. In Deployments, a ReplicaSet is created for each new rollout of a Deployment and is responsible for ensuring that the correct number of pods for that Deployment’s version are running.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Are Environment-Specific Configurations Managed in Kubernetes Deployments?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Environment-specific configurations in Kubernetes Deployments can be managed using ConfigMaps and Secrets, which are decoupled from the deployment configurations. These objects can be mounted into pods as volumes or exposed as environment variables, allowing different configurations for different environments without changing the deployment definition.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are Probes and How are They Used in Deployments?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Probes are used in Kubernetes to determine the health of a container within a pod. There are two types of probes: Liveness probes are used to know when to restart a container, and Readiness probes are used to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. These probes help ensure that only healthy containers are used in deployments.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

<ol><li><p><strong>What is a Pod in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Pod is the smallest and most basic deployable object in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers. These containers in a Pod are scheduled on the same node and share the same network namespace, IP address, and port space.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do Pods Communicate with Each Other in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pods communicate with each other using networking. Since each Pod has a unique IP address within the cluster, they can communicate using standard TCP/IP networking. Pods can also communicate with each other using shared volumes, where data is shared between containers in the same Pod.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is the Lifecycle of a Kubernetes Pod?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The lifecycle of a Kubernetes Pod includes several states: <code><strong>Pending</strong></code> (the Pod has been created, but some of its containers are not yet running), <code><strong>Running</strong></code> (the Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created), <code><strong>Succeeded</strong></code> (all containers in the Pod have terminated successfully), <code><strong>Failed</strong></code> (all containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure), and <code><strong>Unknown</strong></code> (the state of the Pod could not be obtained).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explain the Difference Between a Pod and a Container.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A container is the smallest unit of computing that contains an application and its dependencies. A Pod, on the other hand, is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How are Resources Allocated to a Pod?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Resources such as CPU and memory are allocated to a Pod based on the specifications in the Pod definition. Each container in the Pod can specify a request (the amount of resource guaranteed) and a limit (the maximum amount of resource the container can use). Kubernetes uses these specifications to schedule Pods on nodes with available resources and manage resource usage.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are Multi-Container Pods and When Would You Use Them?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multi-container Pods are Pods that contain more than one container. These containers are tightly coupled and share resources such as volumes and networking. Use multi-container Pods when containers need to work closely together, for instance, a main application container and a helper container that pushes data to or pulls data from an external source.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Do You Manage Pod Scalability in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pod scalability in Kubernetes is typically managed using controllers like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets. These controllers create and manage multiple instances of a Pod to ensure the desired number of replicas are running at any given time, allowing for scaling up or down as needed.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What are Init Containers and How are They Different from Regular Containers in a Pod?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Init containers are specialized containers that run before the application containers in a Pod. They are used to set up the environment for the main application container, such as configuring settings, updating files/directories, or waiting for some condition to be met. Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion, and the Pod's application containers start only after all init containers have completed successfully.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How Does Kubernetes Handle Pod Failures?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kubernetes handles Pod failures using controllers like Deployments and ReplicaSets. If a Pod fails (like in the case of node failure), the controller notices the discrepancy between the desired state and the current state, and creates a new Pod to maintain the desired number of replicas.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can You Describe the Process of Exposing a Pod to the External Network?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> To expose a Pod to the external network, you typically use a Kubernetes Service. A Service provides a stable IP address and DNS name entry for accessing the Pod. For external access, a Service of type <code><strong>LoadBalancer</strong></code> or <code><strong>NodePort</strong></code> is used, which routes external traffic to the Pod either through a cloud providerâ€™s load balancer or by exposing a port on the nodes.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

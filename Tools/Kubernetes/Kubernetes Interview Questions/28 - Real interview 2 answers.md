<ol><li><p><strong>What are Microservices and How Do Containers Benefit Them?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Microservices architecture is a method of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, modular services. Containers are ideal for microservices due to their lightweight nature, allowing each service to be deployed in a separate container with its dependencies, ensuring isolation, resource efficiency, and scalability.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Can Kubernetes be Installed on any Cloud Platform? How?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Kubernetes can be installed on any cloud platform. Most cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services (like AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE) which simplify the installation process. Alternatively, you can manually install Kubernetes using <code><strong>kubeadm</strong></code> or other tools by setting up virtual machines or instances within the cloud provider’s infrastructure.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is Helm and How Does it Relate to Kubernetes Installation?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies installing, configuring, and updating applications on Kubernetes clusters. While it doesn’t install Kubernetes itself, it is used to manage applications running on a Kubernetes cluster. Helm uses a packaging format called charts, which are pre-configured Kubernetes resources.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Describe Node Affinity in Kubernetes.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Node Affinity in Kubernetes is a set of rules used by the scheduler to determine on which node a Pod can be placed. It allows you to constrain which nodes your Pod is eligible to be scheduled based on labels on nodes. For example, you can ensure that a Pod runs on a node with a specific CPU or memory configuration, or in a specific geographic location.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What is a Resource Quota in Kubernetes?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Resource Quotas are a tool in Kubernetes that enable administrators to limit the aggregate resource consumption in a namespace. They can set hard limits on things like the total amount of memory or CPU that can be used by all Pods in a namespace, the number of Pods, Services, or PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace, and more. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant clusters to prevent any single tenant from monopolizing cluster resources.</p></li></ul></li></ol>

# HELM
HELM is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. It streamlines the process of installing, upgrading, and managing applications on Kubernetes clusters.
Helm simplifies this process by automating the distribution of your applications using a packaging format called a `Helm chart`. Much like how yum manages RPM packages for Red Hat, helm manages Helm charts for Kubernetes. Charts maintain consistency across containers while also determining how specific requirements for an application are met.
As the package manager for Kubernetes, Helm enables you to apply the same configuration framework to multiple instances using variable overrides, all based on what matters most to your specific configuration. 

1. **Packaging Kubernetes Applications**:
   - HELM packages Kubernetes applications into charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources required to run an application, along with templates and default configuration values.
   - Charts include YAML files for Kubernetes resources like deployments, services, config maps, and ingresses.
   - HELM allows developers to structure their applications into reusable charts, promoting consistency and best practices in application deployment.
2. **Managing Dependencies**:
   - HELM supports dependency management, allowing charts to depend on other charts. This enables modularization and simplifies the deployment of complex applications with multiple components.
   - Charts can declare dependencies in their `Chart.yaml` file, specifying the name, version, and repository of dependent charts. When installing a chart, HELM automatically resolves and installs its dependencies.
3. **Templating and Configuration**:
   - HELM uses Go templating to generate Kubernetes manifests dynamically. Templates in a chart's `templates` directory allow users to parameterize configurations and customize deployments.
   - Users can define default configuration values in a chart's `values.yaml` file. These values can be overridden during installation or upgrade, enabling customization for different environments or use cases.
4. **Repositories**:
   - HELM charts are distributed via repositories, which are collections of charts hosted on HTTP servers. The default repository is the official HELM Hub, but users can also create private repositories for internal use.
   - Users can add repositories to their local HELM client using the `helm repo add` command. Once added, they can search for, install, and update charts from these repositories.
5. **Release Management**:
   - When a chart is installed, HELM creates a release, which represents an instance of that chart running on a Kubernetes cluster.
   - HELM tracks releases and provides commands for managing them, including installing, upgrading, rolling back, and uninstalling releases.
   - Users can list their installed releases and inspect their status, revision history, and configuration.
6. **Extensibility**:
   - HELM is extensible via plugins, allowing users to add custom commands and features.
   - Plugins can automate common tasks, integrate with external systems, or extend HELM's functionality in various ways.

## HELM Chart
A HELM chart is a package containing all the resource definitions and necessary metadata needed to define, install, and manage an application on a Kubernetes cluster. Essentially, it's a convenient way to organize and distribute Kubernetes applications.

1. **Chart Metadata**: Every HELM chart contains a `Chart.yaml` file which provides metadata about the chart such as the name, version, description, and maintainers.
2. **Templates**: HELM charts include templates for Kubernetes manifest files (YAML). These templates are written in Go templating language and allow for dynamic generation of Kubernetes resource definitions based on values provided by the user or predefined defaults. Templates reside in the `templates` directory within the chart.
3. **Values File**: HELM charts include a `values.yaml` file which defines default configuration values for the chart. Users can override these values during installation or upgrade to customize the behavior of the chart. This enables users to easily tailor the deployment to their specific needs without modifying the chart itself.
4. **Dependencies**: HELM charts can specify dependencies on other charts. This allows for modularization of complex applications and simplifies the management of dependencies between components. Dependencies are declared in the `Chart.yaml` file, and HELM automatically resolves and installs them when the chart is installed.
5. **Chart Hooks**: HELM supports pre-install, post-install, pre-delete, and post-delete hooks which allow users to execute scripts or actions at various points in the lifecycle of a release (an instance of a chart deployed on a Kubernetes cluster). Hooks can be defined in the `templates` directory with filenames prefixed with `hooks-`.
6. **Chart Tests**: HELM charts can include tests to verify the correctness of the installation. These tests can be written using any scripting language and are executed during installation or upgrade to ensure that the chart behaves as expected.
